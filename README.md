# MEDICAL-IMAGE-COMPRESSION-USING-DWT

Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the increasing sophistication of imaging technologies, such as MRI and CT scans, has led to a surge in data volume, necessitating efficient storage and transmission methods. Compression techniques have emerged as indispensable tools to address these challenges while ensuring the preservation of vital clinical information.
In this context, optimizing the lossless transmission of 3D medical images through advanced compression techniques becomes paramount. The primary objective is to enhance compression efficiency while retaining crucial clinical details for accurate diagnosis and treatment. One promising approach is leveraging the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) method, which has demonstrated effectiveness in preserving both functional insights and spatial characteristics without introducing color distortion.
The proposed methodology involves several critical steps. Firstly, preprocessing techniques are employed for image enhancement, ensuring that the resulting compressed images maintain high fidelity to the original data. Next, the images are decomposed using DWT, a process that effectively reduces redundant data while preserving important features. By breaking down the images into different frequency components, DWT facilitates more efficient compression, enabling significant reductions in file size without sacrificing diagnostic quality.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, various metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are utilized. These metrics provide quantitative measures of the fidelity of the compressed images compared to the original data. Through comprehensive evaluation, the superiority of DWT in lossless 3D medical image transmission is demonstrated, highlighting its ability to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.
Overall, the exploration of critical compression modules, including preprocessing for image enhancement and decomposition for accurate representation, underscores the importance of optimized image management in modern healthcare. These findings offer valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers, emphasizing the significance of efficient compression techniques in enhancing patient care and advancing medical imaging capabilities.
